Apple's QuickTime Plug-in for the Internet

Version 1.1 for Windows 3.1 Users


Known Problems
--------------

The Windows plug-in has been developed to work with most browsers. 
However, as with anything that is attempting to be compatible across
multiple applications, some problems are not correctable from within the
plug-in.

The following is a summary of known problems and the browser it is
associated with:


Netscape 3.0, 3.1

* If you click on Stop prior to completing a download on a QTVR movie and 
then attempt to play the movie the browser application will lock up.  The system 
does not lock up.

* If the webmaster has created a link from a QuickTime VR hotspot to a
JPEG or GIF89 image, Navigator will crash when you click on that
hotspot.

* When playing multiple movies in a table. If the browser window is smaller 
than the  table with movies. Upon maximizing the window some movies will 
display parts of other movies. If this happens click on the corrupt movie 
and it will correct itself.

* If you are using Windows 3.1 with Trumpet Winsock. Embedded QuickTime VR 
movies cannot be saved to disk. This does not occur using Windows for 
Workgroups 3.1.1.


Netscape 2.x

* Moving the mouse while a QuickTime movie is playing can cause audio
and video to stutter and temporarily halt.  This occurs only on the
32-bit versions.


Internet Explorer 3.0 for Windows 3.1 (BETA)

* The plug-in could not effectively function in the pre-release beta
version of Internet Explorer for Windows 3.1 that we tested with. We will
evaluate a future release when the product is nearer to completion.


QuickTime Windows 2.1.2

* Changing the bit depth in the settings windows after loading a QT or
QTVR movie into the browser causes the browser to crash with a page
fault.
